    <h1>(The real mother)</h1>
    <img src="./images/child-lifter-1160x859.jpg" width="400px">
    
    <p>Two women were fighting over a child. “He is my child, leave him alone,” cried the lady in the red sari. The poor child was too young to speak.

        “No, he is mine,” cried the woman in the green sari.
        
        Soon a crowd gathered.
        
        The village elders took the quarreling women to a wise man. The village wise man asked the lady in the red sari, “What do you have to say?”
        
        “He is my child, Sir. I was bathing in the river and had left my son on the bank. This woman lifted my child and ran away. I hurriedly dressed and ran after her,” said the woman.
        
        The wise man asked the other woman to explain.
        
        “She is a liar, Sir. I was the one bathing in the river. He is my only child. She came there, picked him up and ran. Luckily I could catch her,” said the other woman.
        
        Villagers who were watching this drama did not know whom to believe.
        
        The wise man got up. Using a twig, he drew a line on the ground. He asked the two women to stand on either side of the line, and placed the child in the middle. As instructed by the wise man, one woman held the child’s left hand and the other, his right hand.

“Now listen to me carefully,” said the wise man, “Both of you need to pull the child to your side. The child belongs to whoever drags him over to her side.”

The woman in red sari pulled the child hard with all her might. As the child cried in pain, the other woman, let him go.

“He is mine,” the woman in the red sari shouted in triumph, even as the other woman broke down in tears.“Wait,” said the wise man turning to the villagers, “Who do you think loves the child more? She who pulled the child to her side or the one who let the child go?”

The villagers answered, “She who let go loves the child more.”

The wise man took the child away from the woman in the red sari. “Only a mother can have a tender heart for her child,” he said.

He handed the child over to the real mother who hugged the child. The child lifter was given a strict warning and allowed to go.

<h1>(Agasthya drinks the ocean)</h1>
<img src="./images/A4_web-1160x870.jpg" width="400px">
<p>The Devas and Asuras were cousins who were always at war. The Devas ruled Devalok, the world above Earth. The Asuras lived in the world below Earth, called Paatal. The Asuras grew stronger after sunset. So, the Asuras always attacked their cousins at night.

    As the sun rose, the Devas grew stronger. They would be ready to attack the Asuras. But the Asuras would disappear! The Devas would search for them in heaven, earth and, below. But the Asuras could not be found anywhere.
    At last the Devas saw the Asuras’ footprints leading to the ocean. Indra, lord of the Devas, shouted, “They are hiding here in the ocean!” 

Vayu, the Wind God, shook in excitement, “Let’s get them!” 

Agni, the Fire God hissed, “But can we fight them under water?”
Indra looked around. He saw Sage Agasthya sitting on the beach, eyes closed in meditation. Indra went up to him, bowed, and sought his help. Agasthya was a powerful sage, who liked the Devas. He agreed to help them. 

Muttering a prayer to the Sun, he dipped his hands in the ocean and scooped some water. Lo, the next moment, all the water of the ocean was drawn into his palms! And the sage drank it all in one gulp!


As the great sage belched with satisfaction, the Asuras stood exposed on the dry ocean bed. 

The Devas pounced on them. Badly beaten, the Asuras fled from battle. The Devas roared in triumph. 

Seeing his cousins running away, Indra thought they would not trouble the Devas again. He thanked Sage Agasthya. “Sage, our job is done. You can now return the water to the ocean bed.”

Agasthya frowned, “Lord Indra, I have drunk and digested all the waters with my powers. How can I now put it back?”

Indra felt bad. Without the ocean all beings on earth would suffer. 

“Only one river can fill this empty space,” said Agasthya looking up at the sky, “We must wait for Ganga to come down to earth.”

Thus began the long wait for Ganga.

 <h1>(The generosity of Rantideva)</h1>
 <img src="./images/KK_01-1160x653.jpg" width="400px">
 <p>Rantideva was born in a rich family. Even as a child, he would share his riches with the needy. He got married and had sons. With no thought for the future, Rantideva and his wife continued to be generous. No one went away from their home empty-handed.Ultimately, Rantideva ran out of money. His family had to go without food for months.

    One day, Rantideva managed to get some rice, ghee, wheat and sugar. The family thanked God for giving them food and sat down to eat. 
    Just then a holy man knocked at their door. Rantideva received the guest by bowing to him and served food to him. The holy man went away satisfied. Half of the food was still left for Rantideva and his family. 

    As they sat down to eat, a hungry farmer came looking for food. Rantideva offered him a seat, made him comfortable, and served him food. The farmer enjoyed his meal.
    
    There was still some food left. Rantideva’s family decided to share whatever had remained. As they sat down to eat, a traveller appeared at the door. He was accompanied by four dogs. He begged for food for himself and his four dogs. 

Rantideva offered whatever was left to the guest. He was happy to see the hungry dogs cleaning up the vessels.

There was no food left by the time the man took his leave.

Rantideva smiled, “God is kind, we have some water left.” Just then he heard someone cry, ”Oh sirs, I’m dying of thirst. Will a kind soul give me some water?”

Rantideva ran out to the street and saw a poor man overcome with thirst. He offered the water to the thirsty man. The man gulped water down.

As Rantideva looked at him, the poor man revealed himself as Brahma, the Lord of Creation.

“Rantideva, the gods came down to earth to test you. We are pleased with your spirit of sacrifice. We will be happy to grant any boon you ask for.”

Rantideva bowed to Lord Brahma and said softly, “May I always share whatever I have with my fellow men.”
